@svetlana1362,"Honestly it was wayyy to fast, nobody can remember everything that was said in these 5 minutes. You'd have to watch at least a few times. BUT that is exactly what I liked. It was quick and I got all the information. I've got an overview on how to start and all the most important things. Now I can go back and slowly rewatch it and stop whenever I have to, in order to understand. Thank you. This was the best video I found on HTML. Keep up the good work."
@Rocky-cc1tg,I just discovered that this is my learning style. I had such a difficult time paying attention to other videos but this was just perfect! Thank you!
@noelradhakrishnan4423,"I have learnt a lot. I thought html was hard but, you made it so easy for me. You made it very understandable and intresting.
You nailed it.
Thank you so much buddy"
@a.prepper4538,"Hey man, new subscriber here. Recently found out about your channel and I have to thank you. Thank you for the amazing videos. I started coding two months ago and I want to become a developer for a living. From tomorrow onwards I will take your advice and code first thing in the morning. As of now, I know the basics of HTML and CSS  and am now learning about JavaScript. I have to say that it is not easy at all for me, but I will never give up because even if it has been only two months, I simply love coding. Thank you again for your videos.
Have a splendid day. God Bless.

-Andrew"
@srivatsanbalaji6238,You are a good role model dude. I majored in CS but hate coding and have been figuring out life for a bit. Watching these videos motivates me to learn more out of comfort zone and pursue new things. Stay safe dude
@caitlinquinn79,"This is such a great video! So much of the dev world seems to be about making things seem impossible and creating a barrier to entry. Like ""oh it's too complex for me to explain"", but this takes that away. Obviously it's not everything I ever need to know about HTML but you are straightforward and present it as a structure, which is what HTML is! It should be fairly straightforward because it's meant to make sense."
@depressedknight369,"wow wonderful..
always love your your videos ️
 please keep it up "
@SleepingDeity,This video would have been heaven sent if I watched it during freshman year. Nice video. It covers everything you need to know
@alien45735,i already lesrned half of the html but for some reason i quit coding for a year and now i don't want to learn all again i just wanted a quick revise to everything i learned and that video helped me a lot
@mikahope1897,This is going to help me on my test and not waist an hour learning about it
@kevinlimbombe9256,Happy you pivoted back to code drip. IMO your channel was at its best when you were doing the short news videos!
@user-fl1xk5fc5n,"Thanks man! I just started HTML today, I was confused when I first tried it out. But when I watched this video, it made it alot easier. Thanks again"
@arnoldxode,My brain is trying to figure out this but it seems like rocket science
@mosley4442,really helpful. i'm trying to learn html and css barebones with just jon ducketts book. i kinda want to use boiler plates but i feel like it'll just be a crutch for me. thanks for the video super helpful.
@kevinrodricks77,"Hi Aaron, I've been watching your videos for a while now and they're really informative and terrific. Thank you so much. Just a quick question, did you ever finish the CS50 Harvard class? Class? I'm just wondering because I am learning quite a lot of interesting information but was wondering if I should persist with it, or go straight to HTML, CSS and JavaScript?"
@TheCodeTinkerer,"Great concise primer guide

1 month later:
After attending a webdev course on Udemy I can say, that hot dang it is a very precise, concise and spot on primer people should watch first before trying out bigger cources on the same topic."

@kabijoshi5949,"Aaron, you are so fast = intelligently smart. Great to hear from you in here. I am 52 and civil - structural engineer. I m thinking of change of my career into something like AI programming or more. Right now since a week, I am looking at anything available for free. Do you recommend me anything that is serious to start with?"
@akshitmittal1251,"Love your summarised vids brother. pls create redux, javascript, react and other mern mean tools vid too. Please"
@WebDevProgrammingChannel-vw4ef,Can any one direct me somewhere that will explain how to make a video like this
@KCoding-code,Thank you so much and also do you mind if you give me tutoring lessons
@revanthk61,Can you teach me the tags and how to visually use them? Give me visualizations to show how a website will look when the code is created as you did in 4:45. I will be happy if you show me how these codes work. Hope you make one for me. Please.
@sunskate-qe8bm,hello!! watch this to Learn the fastest way to get into coding and skill  to make Maney . () thank you!!!
@Online28_JStr78,Just your first 2 mins of your vid taught me more then my stupid IT teacher
@cloakzhimself8335,please do css now bro.. you've helped me a alot
@hikiy,how do I make a URL for my site?
@IcaroJudah,"Perfect video and content. But for me it was a little bit rushed. If your were ""Learn HTML in 10 minutes"", I think you would have one of, or maybe fastest, smartest and efficient learning/tutorial videos. Maybe is my ADHD speaking.."
@susiebadatti7319,Lol DAMN... OK NOW I CAN GO BACK TO ADD MY BUTTON I GET IT KNOW LOL SHEEEWW
@sushilarai3936,"Excuse me Aaron brother, can I please ask a favor from you "
@golddust9355,way too fast for a tutorial. its a short recap for the people who already know web designing inside out. what's the point of watching it again then????
@ibnearabi3640,Your ads are really out of context and even worse.
@spejr879,"Although this information is great, piece of advice: slow down. Not everyone that comes to your channel is an experienced web developer. You’re moving way too fast, as if you downed 20 onces of coffee before you made the video. Slow it down…."
