@srkaczmarowski,This is quite literally everything you learn in the 10 hour CodeAcademy course. Thank you!
@SasiKumarindia,Best 5 minutes of my time  today.
@dantedycer,"This is insane, very well done video, please do these for CSS and JS parts!"
@Robertkokhreidze,This one guy explaining html to me took 45min to explain what html is and you just saved me a year
@jennybennyglitter,Took a 3 month break from codecademy due to life drama and needed a quick refresh of html. You delivered. Superb 
@Appollochan,"That was an awesome refresher, haven't touched HTML for 3 years, but it all came flooding back after this. :)"
@svetlana1362,"Honestly it was wayyy to fast, nobody can remember everything that was said in these 5 minutes. You'd have to watch at least a few times. BUT that is exactly what I liked. It was quick and I got all the information. I've got an overview on how to start and all the most important things. Now I can go back and slowly rewatch it and stop whenever I have to, in order to understand. Thank you. This was the best video I found on HTML. Keep up the good work."
@rezvihossain8195,Everything in one shot. Good for brushing up in 5 mins. Love it. Thanks.
@Mwtorres89,I like your minimalist and basic approach. Enough to give people a grasp of the concept and ignite interest. Thanks!
@aguibanez4821,"Aaron, thank you. Your videos have gotten SO MUCH BETTER through time, it's actually insane and inspiring af. Keep at it mate!"
@GeekyMino,Now this is how high quality video looks like! Great job.
@bracketpair,"Animations are insane, great production quality!"
@Rocky-cc1tg,I just discovered that this is my learning style. I had such a difficult time paying attention to other videos but this was just perfect! Thank you!
@Kyo-iv7mh,"I've been learning how to code for about 6-7 months, and it feels great being able to understand what you're talking about."
@leintethegreat6678,Man this was awesome. I'm so burned out by these extensive tutorials. Fast and quick to the point!
@dcngn_,"For someone who had taken a course years ago without ever using html, this was a perfect briefing. Especially things like the boilerplate autocomplete and the anti div movement."
@shenukaranawaka7051,"Almost all the HTML content in the simplest form possible. Dude, you are just insane."
@ggdgo,"Thanks, Aaron! I've been going through and intro HTML course and I've been bored by all the reading, so videos are appreciated. lol"
@joweemac,"This is very well done!!! Makes what I'm learning much much clearer, thanks!"
@noelradhakrishnan4423,"I have learnt a lot. I thought html was hard but, you made it so easy for me. You made it very understandable and intresting.
You nailed it.
Thank you so much buddy"
@captainboon2978,It's been a while since I've done any HTML. This was an excellent refresher course.
@a.prepper4538,"Hey man, new subscriber here. Recently found out about your channel and I have to thank you. Thank you for the amazing videos. I started coding two months ago and I want to become a developer for a living. From tomorrow onwards I will take your advice and code first thing in the morning. As of now, I know the basics of HTML and CSS  and am now learning about JavaScript. I have to say that it is not easy at all for me, but I will never give up because even if it has been only two months, I simply love coding. Thank you again for your videos.
Have a splendid day. God Bless.

-Andrew"
@srivatsanbalaji6238,You are a good role model dude. I majored in CS but hate coding and have been figuring out life for a bit. Watching these videos motivates me to learn more out of comfort zone and pursue new things. Stay safe dude
@thaihm,"Great review, thank you Aaron! "
@stradivariusboys4040,Honestly it is a very very good recap for any beginner who want to refresh their mind after a week of not coding.
@ivonna3583,Still one of the most amazing and clear videos I've seen on this topic. Thank you very much!
@ryuk_shinigami,Amazing!! never ever seen such a short video packed with everything I need.

@mitsk2002,God bless you. Thank you for summarizing this so beautifully. Very helpful.
@user-kj3em5qe3h,"this is insane and I cant wait to learn more, I actually want to try it to see if I like it."
@caitlinquinn79,"This is such a great video! So much of the dev world seems to be about making things seem impossible and creating a barrier to entry. Like ""oh it's too complex for me to explain"", but this takes that away. Obviously it's not everything I ever need to know about HTML but you are straightforward and present it as a structure, which is what HTML is! It should be fairly straightforward because it's meant to make sense."
@iiKoopa,Best 5 minutes of the day for sure! Definitely gotta come back and watch this a couple more times!
@adriancruz3454,Dude that video-edit/animation was surprisingly good. Coming from someone who designs daily lol.
